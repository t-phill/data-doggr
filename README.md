"In California, an idle well is a well that has not been used for two years or more and has not yet been properly plugged and abandoned to the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resourceâ€™s (DOGGR) satisfaction. Plugging and abandonment involves permanently sealing the well with a cement plug to isolate the oil- and gas-bearing geologic formation from water. If a well is not properly plugged and abandoned, it may provide a path for oil, gas, or other contaminants to migrate through the well and into drinking water or to the surface. There are approximately 30,000 wells in California categorized as idle."

"DOGGR has proposed updated regulations to improve maintenance of idle wells. The regulations specify far more rigorous testing requirements that will better protect public safety and the environment from the potential threats posed by idle wells. The regulations will require idle wells be tested and, if necessary, repaired, or plugged and abandoned."
